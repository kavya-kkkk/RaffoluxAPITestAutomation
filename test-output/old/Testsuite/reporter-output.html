    <p class="alloc">Why do I need a hosted SMTP service like My-Api?</p>
    <p>This won't come as a surprise that many businesses face problems with email deliverability, especially when it comes to emails sent from a website or web applications. Sometimes this also happens to emails sent from desktop clients, like Outlook. The fact gets even more frustrating when it concerns emails sent by your eStore or an eCommerce application, or any other transactional messages. Wouldn't you want to know where these emails go?</p>
    <p>My-Api is the answer to this problem as it provides users with high deliverability and advanced tracking, all the way down to the recipient level. This is what technicians call 'SMTP relay service'. My-Api provides you with a hosted SMTP server built into your email account. So not only can you use your My-Api email to create and send your email blasts and campaigns, but also for personal and transactional emails. My-Api makes it easy to have it all!</p>
    <p>Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set up your eCommerce store to use My-Api as the SMTP server to send automated transactional messages (this includes order confirmations, payment receipts, etc).
      <li>Configure your website or blog (Joomla or Wordpress based) to send emails through My-Api (new post notifications, subscription confirmations etc).
      <li>Configure your email client (Outlook, Bat, iMail etc) to send messages via My-Api.
